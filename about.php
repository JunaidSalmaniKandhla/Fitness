    				<p>Losing weight isn't easy - we know. But by visiting our website, you'll get the tools you need to successfully take weight off - and keep it off. And best of all, you can signup for free, no strings attached. So put away your credit card - you'll never have to pay a cent.</p>
    				<p>Study after study has confirmed the benefits of keeping track of the food you eat and the activity you do. It's simple - the more consistently you track your food intake, the more likely you are to lose weight. That's why every successful weight management program suggests that you keep a food diary and/or an activity log. But recording everything you eat without the right tools can be tedious at best, or simply impossible at worst.</p>
    				<p>At Fitness for All, we focus on making sure you can log your meals as quickly and easily as possible. Because the easier we make it for you, the more likely you are to stay on track, and the more likely you are to succeed in your weight loss goals.</p>
    				<p>Fitness For All wants to help you find what’s good for you. Not like "eat your vegetables, they're good for you." More like “here are some choices you can realistically make and feel good about.”</p>
    				<p>Sure, our articles are science-backed and expert-approved. But we're not the experts—we’re like your friend who’s a little further along—and we know who to turn to for answers and ideas that cut through the noise. We'll empower you to improve and celebrate you when you get better. We're non-judgmental, open-minded, and totally get that the struggle is real—because we've been there too.</p>
    				<p>We believe:</p>
    				<p>That there's no one way to be healthy. What’s good for you is what you’ll stick with, and you’ll stick with what you enjoy.</p>
    				<p>That healthy is about you—how you feel, why you care, and what you're doing about it.</p>
    				<p>That healthy is for everybody and every body. Not about expensive clothes or hard-to-pronounce foods.</p>
    				<p>That healthy is about becoming a greatist: letting go of trying to be perfect—and simply trying.</p>
    				<p>And so it’s our mission to spread this healthyish attitude around the world.</p>
    				<p><b>We are: </b></p>
